    During my time at NIT Agartala I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at college and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time in enhancing my coding skills. My final year project based on <mark>Twitter Data Analysis</mark> also got published in springer series.
