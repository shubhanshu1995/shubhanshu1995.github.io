    We have considered a small Twitter network comprising of WWE superstars & fans as nodes with directed edges from followers to followees, forming a multiple directed graph. The aim is to analyze the influence of nodes based on parameters such as indegree, distance between the influencer & the
    corresponding followers, source of a tweet (celebrity, organization, etc,), number of retweets, number of mentions, and so on, and to study how different features affect the influence of user.
